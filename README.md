# Shirs Time
## Short intro
Well. my wife, shir, wanted a simple application without any configurations to track time she works at her job

simplest application, demonstrating the use of the know how i currently have,  
using my fav tools  
a long roadmap,  
and a clear heart,  
I take my first step into doing this,  
with love, for one of my loves.  
for my wife, with programming. ^^  

## Objective
- Use TTD to make the application.
- Keep the application as simple for the user as can be.

### Client application Tech
- Unity3d.
- Unirx - reactive extensions for unity.
- Zenject - DI/IOC for unity.
- Zenject with Unit Tests - leveraging the 
- Litedb
- Unity asmdef for faster compilations

### Tech Stack - back
- ASP Net
- TBD

### Road map
- make a viable application using only local storage, fully TDD'ed.
- make a backend server application to sync db's by replacing and updating db files. ( make all data available to user that way.) 
- integrate google auth on client and server to make the application db persistent between installs.
- use machine learning to prompt user with local notifications about forgetting to start the application, perhaps other stuff, or other things that will be discerned by the data ( mix heuristics and learning
